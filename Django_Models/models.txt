An essential part of any website is the ability to accept information
from a user and input it into a databse and retrieve information from a database and use it
to generate content for the user

we use models to incorporate a database into a Django Project
Django comes equipped with SQlite

SQLite will work for our simple examples, but django can connect to a variety of SQL engines

To create an actual model, we use a class structure inside of a relevant applications models.py file
Each attribute of the class represents a fields, which is just like a column name with constrains in SQL

SQL operates has a type of field, such as a charfield, integerfield etc


// Steps for connecting a database
1. python manage.py migrate
2. python manage.py makemigrations app_name
3. python manage.py migrate

// To create a superuser(to access the admin dashboard)
1. python manage.py createsuperuser

// MVT(Model View Template) Paradigm
1.  In the views.py file we import any models that we will need to use
2.  Use the view to query the model for data that we will need
3. Pass results from the model to the template
4. Edit the template so that it is ready to accept and display the data from the model
5. Map a URL to the view
