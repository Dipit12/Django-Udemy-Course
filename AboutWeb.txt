When you search something on your web browser, the computer then sends this request as a packet
which includes the IP address of the website you want

it sends this request through wires or a satellite, which eventually links to wires using your ISP

Your ISP will then re-route the request to the appropriate server location using the IP address as the guide

Once your request reaches the server, it can send back the website you asked for

However a full website with content is too big to send as a single packet of data

The packets come with instructions on how to get back to you and reassemble once they reach you

the packets dont care how they get to your location, all of them take different paths
once they reach , the reassemble themselves
all this happens with the speed of light
